    "In this notebook, we will explore LLM services! We'll discuss the reasons for and against deploying LLMs on edge devices alongside ways to deliver powerful models to end users through scalable server deployments like those accessible through the NVIDIA AI Foundation Endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understanding the pros and cons of running LLM services locally vs in a scalable cloud environment.\n",
    "- Getting familiar with the AI Foundation Model Endpoint schemes, including:\n",
    "    - The raw low-level connection interface facilitated by packages like `curl` and `requests`\n",
    "    - The abstractions created to make this interface function seamlessly with open-sourced software like LangChain.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. What kind of model access should you give a person developing an LLM stack, and how does it compare to the access you need to provide to end-users of an AI-powered web application?\n",
    "2. When considering which devices to support, what kinds of rigid assumptions are you making about their local compute resources and what types of fallbacks should you implement?\n",
    "    - What if you wanted to deliver a jupyter labs interface with access to a private LLM deployment to customers.\n",
    "    - What if now you wanted to support their local jupyter lab environment with your private LLM deployment?\n",
    "    - Would anything have to change if you decided to support embedded devices (i.e. Jetson Nano)?\n",
    "3. **[Harder]** Assume you have Stable Diffusion, Mixtral, and Llama-13B deployed on your own compute instance in a cloud environment sharing the same GPU resource. You currently do not have a business use case for Stable Diffusion, but your teams are experimenting with the other two for LLM applications. Should you remove Stable Diffusion from your deployment?\n",

    "## **Part 1**: Getting Large Models Into Your Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from the last notebook that our current environment has several microservices running on an allocated cloud instance: `docker-router`, `jupyter-notebook-server`, `frontend`, and `llm-service` (among others). \n",
    "\n",
    "- **jupyter-notebook-server**: The service that is running this jupyter labs session and hosting out python environment. \n",
    "- **docker_router**: A service to help us at least observe and monitor our microservices.\n",
    "- **frontend**: A live website microservice that delivers us a simple chat interface. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will focus more on the `llm-service` microservice, which you will be using (at least under the hood) to interface with a selection of [**foundation models**](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/foundation-models/)! Specifically, you'll be using a subset of the [**NVIDIA AI Foundation Models**](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com) to prototype AI-enabled pipelines and orchestrate non-trivial natural-language-backed applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$---$$\n",
    "\n",

    "Across just about every domain, deploying massive deep learning models is a common yet challenging task. Today's models, such as Llama 2 (70B parameters) or ensemble models like Mixtral 7x8B, are products of advanced training methods, vast data resources, and powerful computing systems. Luckily for us, these models have already been trained and many use cases can already be achieved with off-the-shelf solutions. The real hurdle, however, lies in effectively hosting these models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deployment Scenarios for Large Models:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **High-End Datacenter Deployment:**\n",
    "> An uncompressed, unquantized model on a data center stack equipped with GPUs like NVIDIA's [A100](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/a100/)/[H100](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/)/[H200](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h200/) to facilitate fast inference and experimentation.\n",
    "> - **Pros**: Ideal for scalable deployment and experimentation, this stack is ideal for either large training workflows or for supporting multiple users or models at the same time.  \n",
    "> - **Cons:** It is inefficient to allocate this resource for each user of your service unless the use cases involve model training/fine-tuning or interfacing with lower-level model components.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Modest Datacenter/Specialized Consumer Hardware Deployment:**\n",
    "> Quantized and further-optimized models can be run (one or two per instance) on more conservative datacenter GPUs such as [L40](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/l40/)/[A30](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/a30-gpu/)/[A10](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/a10-gpu/) or even on some modern consumer GPUs such as the higher-VRAM [RTX 40-series GPUs](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/40-series/).\n",
    "> - **Pros:** This setup balances inference speed with manageable limitations for single-user applications. These sessions can also be deployed on a per-user basis to run one or two large models at a time with raw access to model internals (even if they need quantization).\n",
    "> - **Cons:** Deploying an instance for each user is still costly at scale, though it may be justifiable for some niche workloads. Alternatively, assuming that users can access these resources in their local environments is likely unreasonable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Consumer Hardware Deployment:**\n",
    "> Though heavily limited in ability to propagate data through a neural network, most consumer hardware does have a graphical user interface (GUI), a web browser with internet access, some amount of memory (can safely assume at least 1 GB), and a decently-powerful CPU.\n",
    "> - **Cons:** Most hardware at the moment cannot run more than one local large model at a time in any configuration, and running even one model will require significant amounts of resource management and optimizing restrictions.\n",
    "> - **Pros:** This is a reasonable and inclusive starting assumption when considering what kinds of users your services should support.\n"

Though necessary to deploy large models at scale and maintain strong control over the provided interfaces, these systems often require expertise to set up and generally do not work well for supporting non-developer workflows for only one individual at a time. Such systems are much better for supporting many simultaneous users, multiple models, and custom interfaces.\n",

    "For this course, you'll use the models deployed by NVIDIA, which are hosted as [**NVIDIA NIM Microservices**](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/). The NIM ecosystem consists of microservices that are optimized to run AI workloads for scaled inference deployment. They work just fine for local inference and offer standardized APIs, but are primarily designed to work especially well in scaled environments. These particular models are deployed on NVIDIA DGX Cloud as shared functions and are advertised through an OpenAPI-style API gateway. Let's unpack what that means:\n",
    "\n",
    "**On The Cluster Side:** These microservices are hosted on a Kubernetes-backed platform that scales the load across a minimum and maximum number of DGX Nodes and are delivered behind a single function. In other words:\n",
    "- A large-language model is downloaded to and deployed on a **GPU-enabled compute node** (i.e. a powerful CPU and 4xH100-GPU environment which is physically-integrated in a DGX Pod).\n",
    "- On start, a selection of these compute nodes are kickstarted such that, whenever a user sends a request to the function, one of those nodes will receive the request.\n",
    "    - Kubernetes will route this traffic appropriately. If there is an idle compute node, it will receive the traffic. If all of them are working, the request will be queued up and a node will pick it up as soon as possible.\n",
    "    - In our case, these nodes will still pick up requests very fast since in-flight batching is enabled, meaning each node can take in up to 256 active requests at a time as-they-come before they get completely \"full\". (256 is a hyperparameter on deployment).\n",
    "- As load begins to increase, auto-scaling will kick in and more nodes will be kickstarted to avoid request handling delays.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following image shows an arbitrary function invocation with a custom (non-OpenAPI) API. This was the initial way in which the public endpoints were advertised, but is now an implementation detail. "

    "#### **[NOTES]**\n",
    "\n",
    "**You may notice that the chat models expect \"messages\" as input:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This may be unexpected if you're more used to raw LLM interfaces like those of local HuggingFace models, but it will look pretty standard to users of OpenAI models. By enforcing a restricted interface instead of a raw text completion one, the service can have more control over what the users can do. There are plenty of pros and cons to this interface, with some noteworthy ones below:\n",
    "- A service might restrict the use of a specific role type or parameter (i.e. system message restriction, priming message to get arbitrary generation, etc).\n",
    "- A service might enforce custom prompt formats and implement extra options under the hood that rely on the chat interface.\n",
    "- A service might use stronger assumptions to implement deeper optimizations in the inference pipeline.\n",
    "- A service might mimic another popular interface to leverage existing ecosystem compatibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these are valid reasons, and it's important to consider which interface options are best for your particular use cases when choosing or deploying your own service.\n",
    "\n",
    "**You may notice that there are two fundamental ways of querying the models:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can **invoke without streaming**, in which case the service response will come all at once after it has been computed in full. This is great when you need the entire output of the model before doing anything else; for example, when you want to print out the whole result or use it for downstream tasks. The response body will look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"id\": \"d34d436a-c28b-4451-aa9c-02eed2141ed3\",\n",
    "    \"choices\": [{\n",
    "        \"index\": 0,\n",
    "        \"message\": { \"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Bonjour! ...\" },\n",
    "        \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n",
    "    }],\n",
    "    \"usage\": {\n",
    "        \"completion_tokens\": 450,\n",
    "        \"prompt_tokens\": 152,\n",
    "        \"total_tokens\": 602\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also **invoke with streaming**, in which case the service will send out a series of requests until a final request is sent out. This is great when you can use the responses of the service as it becomes available (which is very good for language model components that print the output directly to the user as it gets generated). In this case, the response body will look a lot more like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "data:{\"id\":\"...\",\"choices\":[{\"index\":0,\"delta\":{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":\"Bon\"},\"finish_reason\":null}]}\n",
    "data:{\"id\":\"...\",\"choices\":[{\"index\":0,\"delta\":{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":\"j\"},\"finish_reason\":null}]}\n",
    "...\n",
    "data:{\"id\":\"...\",\"choices\":[{\"index\":0,\"delta\":{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":\"\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}]}\n",
    "data:[DONE]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these options can be done with relative ease using Python's `requests` library, but using the interface as-is will result in a lot of repetitive code. Luckily, we have some systems that make this significantly easier to use and incorporate into larger projects!"

Luckily, we have some systems that make this significantly easier to use and incorporate into larger projects! One layer of abstraction above using the requests is to use a more opinionated client like that of OpenAI. Since both NVIDIA and OpenAI subscribe to the OpenAPI specification, we can borrow their client instead. Note that under the hood, the same processes are still being done, probably facilitated by a lower-level client like that of [**httpx**](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx) or [**aiohttp**](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp).

    "\n",
    "The goal of a **connector** is to convert an arbitrary API from its native core into one that a target code-base would expect. In this course, we'll want to take advantage of LangChain's thriving chain-centric ecosystem, but the raw `requests` API will not take us all the way there. Under the hood, every LangChain chat model that isn't hosted locally has to rely on such an API, but the developer-facing API is a much cleaner [`LLM` or `SimpleChatModel`-style interface](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/model_io/) with default parameters and some simple utility functions like `invoke` and `stream`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start off our exploration into the LangChain interface, we will use the `ChatNVIDIA` connector to interface with our `chat/completions` endpoints. This model is part of the LangChain extended ecosystem and can be installed locally via `pip install langchain-nvidia-ai-endpoints`."
